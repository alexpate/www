          Hi there, I&apos;m Alex. I build my own products, along side working
          with some amazing companies to help them build theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most recently, I was working with MoonPay to help build the future of
          payments. Before that, I was working with Monzo - the fastest growing
          bank in the UK. Originally joining as a product designer, I
          transitioned into a web engineer role where I worked with a variety of
          teams to help rethink modern day banking for their millions of
          customers.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also worked with Kalo (which eventually became Polywork) where I was
          the first UI Engineering hire. My responsibilities included building
          out the design system as well as ensuring a high bar of design quality
          across the product.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;ve always bounced somewhere between design and engineering,
          however the common thread has always been my love for building things
          that people love to use.
        </p>

        <p>
